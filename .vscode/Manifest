Entry #2:
    V-1.5 REF 08NOV2020
    -> Change Log:
        -> Updated the Pulse Oximeter, now using MAX30101.
        -> The sensor itself has it's own processing so minimal code is required.
        -> Changing the whole codebase to accomodate new sensor.
        -> Going to improve control flow and will try fixing memmory issues beacuse of the OLED library.
        -> Every other sensor stays the same in this change.
